# Quick Start Guide

The simplest and easiest way to get up-and-running with Salable. Monetise your
application in record time.

### Create an account

The first step of the journey is to
[create a Salable account](https://salable.app/signup), if you haven't already!

Once you are in the dashboard, you will have a pre-configured API Key and
["Payment Integration"](./using-the-dashboard/payment-integration/add-salable-payments.md)
ready for use. The payment intgration will need fully connecting before
production use but is suitable for "Test Mode" development immediately.

### Configure your product

You can now create your product in the Salable dashboard. Configure the plans
and features to best suit your intended business model. We support everything
from monthly recurring payments, ad hoc licensing, usage-based billing.

Creating your product in Salable is best done with a "bottom-up" approach.
Start by defining each of your individual features and capabilities, and
then create plans for them to sit within.

### Taking payments

Now you have your product configured, you will need to prompt the user to pay
for your application. We will do this through a simple payment link.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
// Don't forget to: npm install @salable/js
import { getCheckoutLink } from '@salable/js'

const checkoutLink = await getCheckoutLink({
  apiKey: 'your-salable-api-key',
  planUuid: 'your-salable-plans-uuid',
  successUrl: 'https://your.app/payment-success',
  cancelUrl: 'https://your.app/payment-cancelled',
  granteeId: 'your-users-id',
  member: 'your-users-id',
})

// Now you are free to present this `checkoutLink` to your user however you see
// fit.
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```js
// Don't forget to: npm install @salable/node-sdk
import { Salable } from '@salable/node-sdk';

const salable = new Salable('your-salable-api-key', 'v2');

const checkoutLink = await salable.plans.getCheckoutLink('your-plan-uuid', {
  successUrl: 'https://example.com/success',
  cancelUrl: 'https://your.app/cancel',
  granteeId: 'your-users-id',
  member: 'your-users-id',
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl
  -XGET
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_SALABLE_API_KEY'
  -H 'version: v2'
  'https://api.salable.app/plans/your-plan-uuid/checkoutLink?successUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fyour.app%2Fsuccess&cancelUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fyour.app%2Fcancel&granteeId=your-users-id&member=your-users-id'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The payment link is only for an individual plan. If you'd rather showcase
multiple options to the user, consider using a Pricing Table.

### License check

Now users can buy licenses, you can lock certain features/functionalities of
your application depending on whether they've paid or not.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
// Don't forget to: npm install @salable/js
import { getGrantee } from '@salable/js';

const { hasCapability } = await getGrantee({
  apiKey: 'your-salable-api-key',
  productUuid: 'your-products-uuid',
  granteeId: 'your-users-id',
});

const isUserLicensedToPerformAction = hasCapability('your-capability-name');
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```js
import { Salable } from '@salable/node-sdk';

const salable = new Salable('your-salable-api-key', 'v2');

const { capabilities } = await salable.licenses.check({
  productUuid: 'your-product-uuid'
  granteeIds: ['your-users-id']
  });
const isUserLicensedToPerformAction = capabilities.includes(
  'your-capability-name'
);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl
  -XGET
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_SALABLE_API_KEY'
  -H 'version: v2'
  'https://api.salable.app/licenses/check?productUuid=YOUR_PRODUCT_UUID&granteeIds=your-users-id'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Learning more

In just a few steps, you have now: configured your product on Salable, allowed
users to buy licenses, and restricted what a user can do based on the license(s)
they hold.

You can now make money with your project!

But this is just the beginning, Salable can offer a lot more when it comes to
managing seats, usage-based consumption and subscription flexibility.
