# View Licenses

There are two options for viewing the licenses that you have issued using
Salable. You can see the licenses for a specific product from the license tab of
that product's page. This will only show the licenses for that product.

Alternatively, you can use the license section from the left-hand menu. In this
menu, you can see all the licenses that you have issued across all your
products. You can search and filter this list to find the precise license you
want.

The best method will likely depend on how many licenses you have issued.
