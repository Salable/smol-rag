# Pricing Models

Salable offers multiple **pricing models** that you can use for your product.
The **pricing model** is assigned on the plan level, so if you wish, you can
offer more than one **pricing model** to your customers, depending on which plan
they select. You can decide which **pricing model** applies to a plan when you
[**create the plan**](../plans/create-plan).

## Flat Rate Model

If a plan uses the flat rate model, you specify a price and a billing cycle for
the plan, and the customer pays that price each billing cycle.

## Usage-based Model

With the usage-based model, you charge your customers based on how much they use
your product during the billing cycle. When you create a plan, you specify which
feature to use as the basis for usage and the unit price. The customer's usage
of that feature is monitored, and they are billed the appropriate amount at the
end of their billing cycle.

## Per-seat Model

With the per-seat model, your customer pays depending on how many licenses they
use, and the amount they pay per license is fixed. This makes it easy for them
to understand their costs and budget accordingly. They can assign or unassign
seats to users as they see fit, and the amount they are charged is automatically
adjusted to match the number of seats active during the billing cycle.

## Freemium

Offer a free plan with the option of upgrading to paid plans.

## Free trials

As part of any billing model, you can also offer your users free trials for a
set number of days.
