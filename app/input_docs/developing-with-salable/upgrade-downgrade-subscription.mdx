# Upgrade/downgrade subscription

### Change the plan

Useful if you need to update the plan your user is on. For example, if they have
upgraded or downgraded you would want to update the subscription to reflect
this.

:::info

If the new plan has a higher minimum seat number than the number of active seats
on the current subscription, new seats are created when the subscription moves
to the new plan. For example, if a subscription with ten active seats moves to a
new plan with a minimum seat number of fifteen, five new seats are created.

### Example scenarios

An example scenario for upgrading a grantee's subscription could be as follows:

:::note Upgrade Example

A customer has an annual subscription that began on March 4th and costs $180 per
year. On September 15th, they decide to upgrade their subscription to a more
expensive plan, which costs $240 per year. Their subscription is prorated as
follows:

- Seven months (March 4th - October 3rd) on $180 plan: $15 \* 7 = $105.
- Five months (October 4th - March 3rd) on $240 plan: $20 \* 5 = $100.
- Total cost for annual subscription: $105 + $100 = $205.
- The extra cost is the total cost minus the payment already made: $205 - $180 =
  $25.
- The customer is charged $25 to upgrade to the new plan for the remainder of
  their subscription. This payment is taken at the start of their next billing
  period, which is March 4th.

An example scenario for the downgrading of a grantee's subscription could look
like:

:::note Downgrade Example

A customer has an annual subscription that began on March 4th and costs $240 per
year. On September 15th, they decide to downgrade their subscription to a less
expensive plan that costs $180 per year. Their subscription is prorated as
follows:

- Seven months (March 4th - October 3rd) on $240 plan: $20 \* 7 = $140.
- Five months (October 4th - March 3rd) on $180 plan: $15 \* 5 = $75.
- Total cost for annual subscription: $140 + $75 = $215.
- Amount paid on March 4th minus the prorated total cost for the year: $240 -
  $215 = $25.
- The customer is refunded $25 to downgrade to the new plan for the remainder of
  their subscription. This refund is processed at the start of their next
  billing period, which is March 4th.
