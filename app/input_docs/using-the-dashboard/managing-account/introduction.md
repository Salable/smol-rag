# Introduction

Salable is a platform that allows you to easily sell your app to your customers.
Not only can you integrate a payment system within your app, but you can also
set up different plans to suit your customer's needs. Salable is not
platform-specific, so you can use it no matter what your app is built to do, or
where it does it.

Through Salable, you can :

- Set up subscription plans.
- Create multiple plans for a single product with customizable features.
- Issue evaluation licenses to let customers try your product.
- Change the price of your product.
- Easily give licenses to individual users, a Trello or Miro board, or a whole
  organisation.
