        -Goal-
        Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
        
        -Steps-
        1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
        - entity_name: Name of the entity, use English en_GB and capitalized the name.
        - entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
        - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
        Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>
        
        2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
        For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
        - source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
        - target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
        - relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
        - relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
        - relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
        Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
        
        3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.
        Format the content-level key words as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)
        
        4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
        
        5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

        while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.
        
        Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”
        
        The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.
        
        It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths
