title: Migrating to V2 of the API
---

V2 of the Salable API is the result of an effort to consolidate and fortify the
elements that make Salable what it is end-to-end. During this process, we have
improved the security and performance of multiple endpoints.

It is our recommendation that all customers migrate to V2 as soon as possible.

## How do I use V2 of the API?

In order to start using the new and improved V2 endpoints, you'll want to
provide a `version` header with a value of `v2` to each request you send to the
API.

## What has changed since V1?

### Licenses are now paginated

This used to return all licenses for an organisation in one response. The
response in v2 is now paginated, changing the response type. The array of
licenses is now on a data property instead of the entire response being an
array. Ensure you are using the data property to access the license data and
implement pagination using the first, last and cursor parameters if required.

In V1, this endpoint returned all licenses for an organisation in a single
response. Starting from V2, this response will be paginated which alters the
data shape returned by the endpoint.

While before the response was an array, it is now an object with a `data`
property, among others.

Old V1 shape:

```json
[
  // License objects here...
]
```

New V2 shape:

```json
{
  first: '' // ID of first returned license, useful for pagination.
  last: '' // ID of last returned license, useful for pagination.
  data: [
    // Subset of License objects now here...
  ]
}
```


### Change to fetching Licenses for a given Subscription

Previously if you wanted to fetch the Licenses associated with a Subscription
you could use the `GET /subscriptions/{id}` endpoint with an `expand` value of
`licenses`. As of V2, this data has been removed from the get subscription
endpoint.

Now if you want this data, the way to fetch it is by providing a
`subscriptionUuid` to the `GET /licenses` endpoint.

V1: `GET /subscriptions/123?expand=licenses`

V2: `GET /licenses?subscriptionUuid=123`

### A new way to modify a Subscription's Plan

The [update Subscription's plan endpoint](https://docs.salable.app/api#tag/Subscriptions/operation/updateSubscriptionPlan)
has been deprecated. You can achieve the same with the
[change Subscription plan endpoint](https://docs.salable.app/api/v2#tag/Subscriptions/operation/changeSubscriptionsPlan).
The latter endpoint also offers additional parameters to modify the proration
behaviour applied when your customer's plan changes.


### Removal of checkout links from pricing table endpoint

V2 no longer generates Stripe checkout links for each plan on the pricing table
endpoint. Our own pricing table components have moved to dynamically fetching
the checkout links when the user clicks the purchase button. This change lead to
better performance as a result of fewer calls to the Stripe API.

If you need to get the checkout link for a plan, you can still do so with the
[get Plan checkout link endpoint](https://docs.salable.app/api/v2#tag/Plans/operation/getPlanCheckoutLink).
