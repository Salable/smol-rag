# API Overview

Salable is designed to be a flexible tool to allow you to integrate your app
with your chosen payment provider easily. The advantage of using Salable is that
you can more easily make changes to your pricing structures, and you can offer
more options to your customers.

Our APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) use HTTP endpoints that accept
requests with JSON arguments and return JSON responses. Authentication is via
API key in the header.

To get up and running, you need to work through the following steps.

1. Set up a [**Salable Account**](../getting-started/create-an-organization) and
   Organization
2. Connect your [**Stripe**](../payment-integration/add-stripe-to-salable) account to Salable or create a Salable payment integration
3. Build your [**products**](../products/create-a-product) and
   [**plans**](../plans/create-plan)
4. Generate your [**API key**](../api-keys/generate-api-key)
5. Make your first API call
