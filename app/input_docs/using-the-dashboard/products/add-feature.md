# Add a Feature

Features are the specific benefits, augmentations, or liberties that are
delivered by a product. The features a client gets depend on the plan they buy.
While capabilities are the same in all plans, features are not.

Features can be anything. They can be actual functionality in your app, access
to a service, or a nontangible benefit. Each product can have an unlimited
number of features.

## Instructions

## Update Feature Order

are the order in which they are displayed on your pricing table. By default,
they are listed in the order they were created. You can change this order by dragging the features into the order you want them to display.
