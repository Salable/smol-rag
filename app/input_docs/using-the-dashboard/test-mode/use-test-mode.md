# Using Test Mode

All of Salable's functionality is also offered within Test Mode. You can create
a product along with its capabilities, features, plans, and pricing tables. You
can create licenses and payment integrations. You can create webhooks and API
keys. This full functionality allows you to rest assured that the behavior you
see in Test Mode is replicated in your production environment.

## Enable/Disable Test Mode

You can switch between Test Mode and Live Mode by clicking the toggle in the
bottom left-hand menu.

You can tell if you are in test Mode as the Test Mode toggle is orange, and there
is a TEST MODE indicator at the bottom of the page.

You can move back to Live Mode by clicking the toggle again to turn off Test
Mode.

## Using Salable in Test Mode

As we've said, you can do everything in Test Mode that you can do in Live Mode.
The functionality is exactly the same. Simply follow the instructions provided
in the topics in the left-hand menu just as you would if you were performing an
action in Live Mode.

## Copy a Test Mode product to Live Mode

Once you've completed your tests and you're satisfied that a product is ready to
move from Test Mode to Live Mode, all you have to do is go to the Products page
and click on the menu icon for the product you want to move to Live Mode and
then select **Copy to live mode** from the menu displayed.

:::note

You must have at least one payment integration configured in Live Mode when you
move a product to Live Mode. If you don't have a payment integration configured,
Salable
**[prompts you to create one](https://docs.salable.app/docs/category/payment-integration)**
before it allows you to move a product to Live Mode.

If you have more than one payment integration configured, you'll be asked to
select which payment integration you want to use for the product.
