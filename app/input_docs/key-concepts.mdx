# Key Concepts

### Grantee

The entity that a [License](#license) is assigned to. This could be an
individual user, a team, an organisation, a Trello board, a Slack channel, or
anything else that is uniquely identifiable.

### Feature

Attached to a [Plan](#plan) and used to toggle functionality for
[Grantees](#grantee) within your application. Features can contain boolean
(on/off), numeric, or text values.

### Capability

Typically used to offer bespoke or "one off" functionality to a
[Grantee](#grantee) within your application. These values are fixed, they will
not change for the licenses duration. Read more about the differences between 
Features and Capabilities in [The Salable Way](./the-salable-way.mdx#should-i-use-features-or-capabilities)

### Plan

Grouping of [Features](#feature) and [Capabilities](#capability) that a
[Grantee](#grantee) can be given a license for. For example, you may have
"Basic" and "Pro" plans in your application.

### License

Assigned to a [Grantee](#grantee) and describes what they can access based on
the associated [Plan](#plan).

### Subscription

A recurring payment that is made at a chosen interval. For ad-hoc licenses or
free plans - subscriptions don't exist.

### Payment Integration

An external payment provider (such as Stripe), that you link with your Salable
account in order to collect payments.
