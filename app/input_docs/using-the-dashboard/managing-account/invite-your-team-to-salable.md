# Invite Your Team to Salable

You may need to give other members of your team access to your Salable
dashboard. You can add as many team members as you need to your organisation.

## Instructions

1. Select the **Settings** from the bottom of the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Select the **Team** tab.
3. Select the **Invite Member** button.
4. Enter your team member's email address.

An email is sent to the email address provided. From the email, your team member
can create their own account for Salable. Their account is automatically linked
to your organisation.

You can view the status of invited team members by selecting **Settings** from
the left-hand menu and viewing the _Team_ tab. You can revoke an invite by
clicking the menu icon for the relevant team member and selecting **Revoke
Invite**.

By default, new members of your team will only have read access to your Salable
instance. You can read how to edit their permissions on the
[**Manage Your Team**](../getting-started/manage-your-team#edit-permissions)
page.
