# Add a Pricing Table

A pricing table allows you to display the various plans available for your
product on one screen to allow easy comparison by your customer. A default
pricing table is automatically created for each of your products. The default
pricing table includes all plans with a _Plan Type_ of _Standard_ or _Coming
Soon_.

Salable's pricing table functionality enables you to design your pricing table,
and it then generates the code that you need to display the pricing table. You
can copy the code in Vanilla JS or React.

## Use the Default Pricing Table

A default pricing table is automatically created for each of your products. The
default pricing table displays all plans with a _Plan Type_ of _Standard_ or
_Coming Soon_.

You can view the default pricing table by selecting the three dots under **Actions**. If you are happy with the default table, select the three dots under **Copy Code** and choose whether you want the React code or the Vanilla JS code for the pricing table. This copies the relevant code to your clipboard, and you can paste it where required
from there.

## Create a Pricing Table

If you want to display a pricing table that only includes specific plans,
highlights a particular plan, uses the dark theme, or uses a different colour
scheme for the buttons, then you must create that pricing table. Follow these
instructions to create a pricing table.

1. Select **Products** from the navigation menu on the left-hand side.
2. Select the product you want to configure.
3. Select the **Pricing Tables** tab on the sidebar.

   | Name          | Name of the pricing table for reference within the Salable dashboard. This name is not visible to customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | Add Plans     | Use this dropdown to select which plans you want to include in the pricing table. <br /><br />The plans are displayed in the order they are selected, but you can reorder them here by drag-and-dropping the plans in the required order. <br /><br />You can highlight a specific plan in your pricing table by selecting the <i>Featured</i> radio button for that plan. Highlighting a plan displays it to your customers with different styling to emphasise that plan. |
   | Feature Order | If your plan has multiple features, you can order them as you wish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

6. Select **Create Pricing Table**.

You should see a notification telling you that your pricing table has been
created.

## Edit a Pricing Table

Once you have created the pricing table, you are taken to the editor page for
that pricing table. You can also enter the editor page for a pricing table by
selecting the three dots under **Edit** from the Actions menu on the _Pricing Tables_ page.

:::note You cannot edit the default pricing table, like reordering the plans. The only way of removing a plan from the default pricing table is if you create or edit a plan and choose **No** on the **Show in the default pricing table?** section:::

You can use the editor to make changes to your pricing table. You can view any
changes you make in the preview pane once you click the **Update Pricing Table**
button.
