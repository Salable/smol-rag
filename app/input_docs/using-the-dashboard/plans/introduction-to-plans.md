# Introduction To Plans

Plans are the options you give your customers. Each plan can contain a different
set of features, have an individual price, and a specific billing interval.
Plans let you offer your customers the right level of value for their needs.

Products can add as many plans as you need to suit your needs.

You can share the details of your plans using our Pricing Tables, which you can
embed into your website and app.
