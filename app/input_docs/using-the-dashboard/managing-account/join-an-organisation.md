# Join an Organisation

To join an existing organisation, the organisation owner will need to
[**send an invite**](./invite-your-team-to-salable). Once they have done this,
you will receive an email with a link. You may need to check your junk folder.

1. Follow the link or select **Accept Invitation** in the email.
2. Provide your name and choose a secure password.
3. Click **Accept invite**.

Your account is created and you are automatically added to the organisation that
sent the invitation.
