# The Grantee System

To faciliate access to functionality in your product, you create and assign licenses. The license broadly describes two things: what features and capabilities can be accessed, and the _thing_ that the license belongs to.

This _thing_ could be just about anything. It could be a user, an organisation, a Trello board, a Miro team; if it can be uniquely identified in some way, a license can belong to it.

In Salable we call this _thing_ that the license belongs to the **Grantee**.

From a technical perspective, this “Grantee” is no more complicated than a string. It is just a sequence of characters that describes the license holder.

This set of characters only needs to meet three criteria:
1. It needs to uniquely describe the _thing_ that the license will belong to. For example, a User ID from your database or a Board ID from Trello.
2. It should be a value that doesn’t change. For example, an email address might not be a good Grantee ID if you allow the user to update it within your system.
3. It shouldn't contain any commas. We use commas to determine where one grantee definition ends and another begins.

You can change the Grantee a license belongs to—but these should always be intentional changes, not changes that happen by accident as illustrated in criteria two.

And because the Grantee ID is represented by a string, we’re free to join together any combination of values we see fit to represent _what_ the license belongs to. It could be that the license just belongs to a `user_id`, or just to a `board_id` or to a `user_id board_id` (a specific user, on a specific board). The possibilities that this system offers are virtually limitless.

So you’ve got options, what you assign your licenses too will really come down to your business model and how you plan to monetise your application.

Now go and build something great.
