# Issue an Evaluation License

If you need to issue an evaluation license to a customer, you can do that
directly from your organization's homepage. All you will need is your customer's
email address.

## Instructions

1. Select **Licenses** from the sidebar. Then select **Create New License**.
2. The **Create License** sidebar will open. It has the following parameter:-
   - [**Grantee ID**](./grantee-ids.md): The identifier used to check if there
     is a valid license.
   - **Licensee Email**: The email address for the customer receiving the
     evaluation license.
   - **Product & Plan**: First select the product from the drop-down menu, then
     the plan level.
   - **Let Expire/Renew Forever**: For an evaluation license, you will want to
     select **Let Expire**.
3. Once you have completed the fields the Expiration Date Parameter appears. It
   will default to the cycle time of the plan, but you can manually change it.
4. Select **Create License**.
