# Edit a License

Some of the parameters of the License can be updated in the Salable Dashboard.
You can update the grantee id and suspend a license. Making other changes is not
currently possible. If you need to change something outside of these parameters,
the best course of action is to suspend the license and then
[**issue a new**](./issue-free-license.md) one.

### Update the Grantee ID

1. Select **Products** from the navigation menu on the left-hand side.
2. Select the product you want to configure.
3. Navigate to the **Licenses** tab
4. [**Find the license**](./view-licenses.md) you are looking for.
5. Select the license ID or select the pencil icon on the license ID.
6. Select the **Grantee ID** field on the edit license page and update as
   required.
7. Select **Update License**

### Suspend a License

You can suspend a license from the Salable Dashboard or use an
[**API method**](https://docs.salable.app/api/v2#tag/Licenses/operation/cancelLicense).

1. [**Find the license**](./view-licenses.md) you are looking for.
2. Select **Suspend License** on the bin icon.

:::caution Suspend Once you Suspend a license, you can't reactivate it.
