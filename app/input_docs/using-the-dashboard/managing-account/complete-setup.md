# Complete Your Setup

There are three more steps that need to be completed for your initial Salable
setup.

1. Create an API key: You need this so that you can use the Salable dev tools.
2. Set up a payment integration: Salable has its own payment integration, but it
   also supports Stripe.
3. Create a product: Provide details of the product you are providing to your
   users.

Once these are complete you are ready to go. You can view these steps by
selecting **Setup** from the left-hand menu.

This displays a window showing which steps have been completed, and providing
links to help you complete each step.
