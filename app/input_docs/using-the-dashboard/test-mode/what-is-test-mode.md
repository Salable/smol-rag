# What is Test Mode?

Test Mode within Salable provides an environment where you have all the
functionality that Salable offers, but any changes made in Test Mode do not
affect your production environment.

You can create a product, test it, and then make any required changes, all while
remaining in Test Mode. Once you're happy that everything works as expected, you
can convert it to a live product simply by clicking a button.

All of the functionality of Salable is available in Test Mode, so you can test
thoroughly and be assured that the product behaves the way you want it to before
converting it to a live product.
